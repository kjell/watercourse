We are thrilled to formally announce our 3rd annual celebration and fundraiser on **Saturday, November 12th, 2016**.

Come and enjoy our free Brunch, while gathering with friends and community:
- Featured speaker Hector Matascastillo, Hector is former veteran and now a psychotherapist contracting with Life Development Resources and the Domestic Abuse Project specializing in the impact of trauma
- A fantastic silent auction and wellness stations
- Our 2nd annual staff award
- The Future of Watercourse: updates on our programs, construction, and renovation project

We are very excited for this event, as we have a $10,000 matching grant from the Pohlad Family Foundation, whereby **all contributions received from new individual donors will be matched up to $500 per person**. We are looking forward to a successful event, and thank you for your participation in supporting emotional health & wellness, and our Minneapolis Public School students!
