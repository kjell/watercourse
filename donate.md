## Imagine that you've lived in three apartments and attended two schools since your last birthday.

With each move, you lose contact with friends, neighbors, and teachers; after school your only option is to be at home to watch your younger siblings so your mother can work.
 
We believe support should be available for the many homeless and highly mobile students and parents that attend our schools. In three of our seven school locations, forty percent of students have unstable housing.
 
For a number of years, we have been able to access funding to help immigrant and refugee students adjust to the change in their lives, and we want to expand these programs to students coming from communities where generational poverty or unfortunate circumstances create similar needs.

## Together we can build a stronger community to help students adjust to changes that are beyond their control.

Your donation will allow us to build and grow these programs to support students in transition
 
* Sunshine Circles: a weekly classroom partnership with teachers to help students feel welcomed and nurtured
* Parenting Through Change, a 14-week parenting skills group to teach parents new ways to monitor, set limits, and provide encouragement for their children as they deal with changes in their own lives
* Tree of Life groups, a curriculum to help students in transition assess their strengths and resources, identify goals, and learn skills to overcome challenges as they reach for those goals.
* An adaptation of our successful 12-week acculturation groups for refugees from East Africa, to help students from other communities


## All gifts make a big impact.
