>"I'd love to see even more students served by this program. It's amazing." - School principal

Last year, our therapists worked with 367 children and teens across Minneapolis. Well over half (66%) were receiving mental health services for the very first time.

And yet, we need your help to reach the growing need. 1 in 5 of our school-based services do not have predictable funding at this time. In this season of giving, we hope you'll consider making a tax-deductible contribution to our work.
