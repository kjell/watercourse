### Every day, our work makes a big impact. Now, you can, too.

Thanks to the generosity of the Pohlad Family Foundation, all new gifts will be matched up to $500 until October of this year. Your first-time gift has double the impact, so if you give $100, the Pohlad foundation will turn it into $200!

Last year, our therapists worked with 367 children and teens across Minneapolis. Two-thirds were receiving mental health services for the very first time.

Although we continue to grow, 1 in 5 of our school-based services do not have predictable funding at this time. We hope you'll consider making a tax-deductible contribution to our work.

### Ways to Give

You can make a one-time or monthly donation using Paypal. (You don't need a Paypal account to give). And remember, eligible donations will be matched up to $500!

"If Watercourse wasn't in our schools, I don't think these kids would get the care they need. Right now, there's a waiting list 40-50 kids long for the mental health program." - Community partner
