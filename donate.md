### Last year, our work made a big impact, but we need your help to reach the growing need.

Last year, our therapists worked with 367 children and teens across Minneapolis. Well over half (66%) were receiving mental health services for the very first time.

Although we continue to grow, 1 in 5 of our school-based services do not have predictable funding at this time. In this season of giving, we hope you'll consider making a tax-deductible contribution to our work.

### Ways to Give

You can make a one-time or monthly donation using Paypal. (You don't need a Paypal account to give)

"If Watercourse wasn't in our schools, I don't think these kids would get the care they need. Right now, there's a waiting list 40-50 kids long for the mental health program." - Community partner
