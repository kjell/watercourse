# Clinic-based services

## Two Clinics, One Mission

Watercourse Counseling Center operates two community clinics. Each offers individual, family, and couples counseling for adults and children.

We work with general mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, life transitions, grief and loss, self-care, self-esteem and stress management.  We also help clients with addiction and impulse control, parenting and healthy development, relationships, sexuality and sexual orientation, identity, and spiritual connection.

## Call us to get started

Call us at [612-822-8227](tel:612-822-8227) to speak with a staff member or leave a voicemail message.

To start services, you can complete a brief (5-10 minute) phone intake, or schedule a free consultation about our services.

During your first session, your therapist will be asking questions about your immediate concerns and gather additional background information to help determine your goals.

### Payment options:

We will work with you to make sure you can afford the services that you need. We accept most insurance plans and many EAP programs. For those who do not have insurance, we also offer a sliding fee option.

Unfortunately, we are unable to offer sliding fee rates to clients covered by insurance plans.

Please call us to see whether your insurance will cover services at Watercourse, or for information about our sliding fee payment options.

# School-based services

## Why School-based services?

Students and families are significantly more likely to access school-based services than they are to complete a referral to an outside agency.  In order to make services accessible to children and families in the community, we partner with Minneapolis Public Schools to operate mental health clinics at five locations in South and North Minneapolis. These services are designed to support and enhance education outcomes for students at risk.

## What do you offer?

**For individual students and families**, we provide individual counseling and play therapy for children with specific mental health needs; parent education, support and counseling; family counseling; and skill building.

**For groups of children or parents**, we lead skill-building groups, parent training, and classroom presentation.

**For teachers and school staff**, we offer consultation and training.
