Watercourse Counseling Center, founded in 1999, is a nonprofit agency
established to improve the emotional health of our diverse community.

Our mission is to solve problems through community partnership; locate
services in community locations; and mentor mental health professionals
and others in community outreach and collaboration.

# [Our Services](http://watercoursecounseling.org/services/)
We provide individual, family, couples, and group
counseling for adults and children. We offer support that is
community-based, affordable, and accessible.  Our staff are culturally
sensitive and respectful, and work hard to ensure the services you
receive are collaborative, empowering, and healing.

We often work with general mental health issues such as
depression, anxiety, life transitions, grief and loss, self-care,
self-esteem and stress management.  We also help clients with addictions
and impulse control, parenting and healthy development, relationships,
sexuality and sexual orientation, identity, and spiritual connection
