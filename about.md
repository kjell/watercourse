established to improve the emotional health of our diverse community.

Our mission is to solve problems through community partnership; locate
services in community locations; and mentor mental health professionals
and others in community outreach and collaboration.

community-based, affordable, and accessible.  Our staff are culturally
sensitive and respectful, and work hard to ensure the services you
receive are collaborative, empowering, and healing.

# How we can help

We often work with general mental health issues such as
depression, anxiety, life transitions, grief and loss, self-care,
self-esteem and stress management.  We also help clients with addictions
and impulse control, parenting and healthy development, relationships,
sexuality and sexual orientation, identity, and spiritual connection
