Our 2015 Achieving Balance brunch was a great success. Thanks to your overwhelming show of support, we raised $10,000 in support of community mental health services.

Special thanks to featured speaker [John Bauer](https://www.minnpost.com/mental-health-addiction/2015/04/grieving-father-hopes-upcoming-art-exhibit-will-inspire-conversation){:target="_blank"}, and to our sponsors:

* [Parkdale Therapy Group](http://www.parkdaletherapy.org/){:target="_blank"}
* [Vela Strategy](http://velastrategy.com/){:target="_blank"}

Thank you, also, to all who donated to our silent auction.
