Are you a teen, transracial, international adoptee? Are you entering 9-12 grade?

This summer, meet other adoptees who share similar experiences in a no-cost group: **TRIA: Our Stories Our Lives**

**What is this group?**
- New, 10-week **no-cost emotional wellness group** for teen youth
- **Led by adoptees!** "For us, by us," which means we "get it"!
- Connect with other teens (No need to "explain adoption" to them)
- Tell your stories in a safe(r) space and navigate your emerging identities
- Explore how you relate to others, express feelings, and form relationships
- Combine all your experiences in a way that makes them meaningful for you

Through FUN and CREATIVE activities (and LOTS of snacks!!!), we'll help you discover more of yourself to be comfortable in your own skin, while highlighitng issues that many teen adoptees grapple with. You will leave empowered, and with new friends!

The group will be led by TRIA therapists Julie Jong Koch, MSW, LICSW and Jessica Shultz, MA.
