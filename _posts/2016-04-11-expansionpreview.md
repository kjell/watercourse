title: We're expanding our South Clinic!
---

If you attended our 2015 brunch, you may remember seeing some architectural drawings propped up along the wall. After months of community meetings, zoning meetings, staff meetings... well, you're getting the idea. Anyhow, we're finally able to say with confidence that we are expanding our South Clinic.

Over the next few months, we'll share day-to-day progress [on our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/watercoursecounseling/), Instagram (@watercoursecounseling), and Twitter (@WatercourseMN). For now, we'll leave you with a taste of the changes to come.
