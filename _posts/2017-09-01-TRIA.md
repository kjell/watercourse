We are happy to announce our final TRIA group of 2017.

TRIA: Our Stories Our Lives, is an ADULT THERAPY GROUP for Transracial International Adoptees age 18+. 
This will be the last group under our current funding and model. 

There has long been a need for ongoing support for adults, because as we know,
adoption is not a one-time event. We continue to be deeply thankful to the 
Community Innovation Grant that made this possible, provided by
Headwaters Foundation for Justice and Bush Foundation.
Our first group was a resounding success and our second group is in progress. 
 
This therapy group model is a first in the Twin Cities,
and one of a very few in the U.S. that is led by the adoptee community
for the adoptee community. Our purpose is for participants to achieve an overall outcome of increased emotional health. We wish for connection through access to collective safer spaces to process the complexity of our experiences. 

**DETAILS BELOW**

Are you a transracial, international adult adoptee? Do	you	want	to meet	other	adoptees	who	share	similar	experiences?

This	fall,	join	TRIA:	Our	Stories	Our	Lives, a	new	project	sponsored	by Watercourse	Counseling	Center, with	the	financial	support	of	Headwaters Foundation	for	Justice &	the	Bush	Foundation.

TRIA: Our	Stories	Our	Lives is	a	new,	12-week	no-cost	adoptee-led	therapy	group for	adults
that	will	offer	the	power	of	community	and	collective	process	to	help	discover,	unfold,	reclaim	
and	retell	our	stories.	Holding	the	philosophy	of	“for	us,	by	us,”	our	goal	is	to	provide
therapeutic	space	that	allows	participants	to	connect	with	others,	expand	emotional	health,	
enhance	the	positive	development	of personal	and	racial	identity,	and	receive	guidance toward
growth	and	integration of	individual	and collective	experiences.


Minnesota	is	home	to	one	of	the highest concentrations of	Transracial	International	Adoptees
(TRIAs).	Our	experiences	are	unique	but	carry	a	common	thread	through	the	separation	from	
our	first	families	and	original	culture. Being raised	in	the	Midwest,	often by	White	families, our	
identities	and	lived	experiences	are	complex.	As	we	uncover	the	layers of	our	lives,	we	can	
reveal	and	understand	our	whole	selves.

The group will be led by TRIA therapists Julie Jong Koch, MSW, LICSW and Jessica Shultz, MA.

**When:** Weekly on Wednesdays 6-8pm, from September 27-December 13, 2017 (12 weeks)

**Where:**
Watercourse Counseling Center South Clinic
3548 Bryant Ave S, Minneapolis

**The Details:** Enrollment is limited to 10 participants, and attendance at all 10 sessions is expected. Snacks, refreshments, and all materials are provided. Selection of participants will be based on adoptee self-interest, availability, appropriateness for group setting, and other factors.
