In case you missed it, we've got a big renovation project in the works. By adding space to our South Clinic, and remodeling existing space, we'll be able to serve even more clients and to offer new services like groups. Exciting, right? But that's not all.

Our renovation plan includes three phases:

1. A new addition, featuring a wheelchair-accessible bathroom and therapy room, a large room for groups and community events, and a great new lobby
2. Beautification, including a green roof on the new addition (seriously, how cool is that!?), a relaxing community patio, and new landscaping
3. Re-modeling of the main floor in the old building, including a new play therapy room

Clearing space for the new addition will begin soon, and we plan to finish the project before programs gear up in the fall.

Keep in touch! Over the next few months, we'll share day-to-day progress [on our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/watercoursecounseling/), Instagram (@watercoursecounseling), and Twitter (@WatercourseMN).
