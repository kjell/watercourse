In collaboration with Watercourse Counseling Center and with the
financial support of Headwaters Foundation for Justice & the Bush
Foundation, we are excited to announce TRIA: Our Stories Our Lives.

TRIA: Our Stories Our Lives is a new, no-cost adoptee-led therapy group
for adults that will offer the power of community and collective process
to help discover, unfold, reclaim and retell our stories. Holding the
philosophy of “for us, by us,” our goal is to provide therapeutic space
that allows participants to connect with others, expand their emotional
health, and receive guidance toward growth and integration of their
experiences. 

Minnesota is home to one of the highest concentrations of Transracial
International Adoptees (TRIAs). Our experiences are unique but carry
a common thread through the separation from our first families and
original culture. Being raised in the Midwest, often by White families,
our identities and lived experiences are complex. As we uncover the
layers of our lives, we can reveal and understand our whole selves.

The group will be led by TRIA therapists Julie Jong Koch, MSW, LICSW and
Jessica Shultz, MA.

When: Weekly on Wednesdays 6-8pm, for a 12-week period from March 29th through June 14th.

Where: 
Watercourse Counseling Center South Clinic
3548 Bryant Ave S, Minneapolis

Enrollment is limited to 10 participants, and attendance at all 12 sessions is required.  Snacks, refreshments, and all materials provided.
