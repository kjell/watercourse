## Demmie Rosenberg, MA, LMFT
 
I work with adolescents, adults, families and couples.
 
### Experience:

I have many years of experience working as a therapist and in health care as a registered nurse. I possess competencies in relationship building and thinking systematically about change.  
 
### Counseling Philosophy:

I believe in the power of change and that something we perceive as an obstacle can be overcome by changing the way we look at it.
 
 
## Emily Brown Murphrey, PsyD, LP
 
I work with children/adolescents, adults, trauma, LGBT, Native American, victims/witnesses of domestic violence, attachment (children and adults), and various religious concerns.
 
### Experience:

I have competency in play therapy, trauma and attachment, sand tray work, relational psychodynamic psychotherapy, group therapy, and completing level 1 trauma training through Senoriation psychotherapy institute. I have experience as a childrenâ€™s therapist with the Domestic Abuse Project, Jewish Family and Children Services, and approximately 10 years working with kids in residential settings, crisis work, and mental health case management.
 
### Counseling Philosophy:

Therapy is a process and I believe my job is to help the client discover and trust his or her own therapeutic process. I also believe in a holistic approach  addressing emotions, bodily sensations, and spirituality when appropriate.
 
## Jean Eich, PsyD, LP
 
I work with individuals aged 12 and older dealing with a wide range of concerns, including (but not limited to) panic, post-traumatic stress, grief and loss, GLBT issues, and personality disorders.
 
### Experience: 

I have worked in schools, hospitals, private practice, and community mental health. I have expertise in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and have published a book on DBT for adolescents.
 
### Counseling Philosophy: 

I believe in working collaboratively to help clients to validate and accept themselves and to identify and change thoughts and behaviors that contribute to mental health concerns.
 
## Stephanie Hanson, MA, LPC
 
I work with children, adolescents, adults, couples and families, survivors of trauma, those with attachment issues and those experiencing grief and loss.
 
### Experience:

Through my work as a counselor I have had the privilege of helping children and adults of various races and backgrounds nurture their strengths, sense of self and personal efficacy. My competencies include working with clients facing anxiety and depressive disorders, trauma, and adjustment to life changes, as well as play therapy and group therapy facilitation.  My background includes working with survivors of domestic abuse, children in day treatment, and people who are homeless and highly mobile.  I joined Watercourse Counseling Center in 2006.
 
### Counseling Philosophy:

My therapeutic approach is eclectic and strength-based. It combines supportive, behavioral, cognitive and psychodynamic techniques.  I see therapy as a journey with many paths and many possible outcomes, and believe the most essential tool to navigating this journey is the relationship built between the client and the therapist. Everyone has a unique reality and deserves understanding and acceptance, and I hope to help those I work with connect with and appreciate their authentic self.
