We operate from a fundamental belief in the power of relationships in life and in healing.  Our approach relies on collaboration in which each person matters and in which each personâ€™s abilities, sense of self, and life experiences are valued and utilized.

Your counselor is an important part of the therapeutic process. Our services are provided by:

     PhD-level Licensed Therapists
     MA-level Licensed Therapists
     Professional Counselors
     Graduate level Trainees

Our staff embrace the values of our organization, and are dedicated to providing support that is collaborative, empowering, accessible, respectful, and culturally sensitive. We will work with you to determine your goals and support you in finding the directions or courses that will help you reach them.
