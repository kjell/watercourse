Jean Eich, PsyD, LP

I work with individuals aged 12 and older dealing with a wide range of concerns, including (but not limited to) panic, post-traumatic stress, grief and loss, GLBT issues, and personality disorders.

Experience:

I have worked in schools, hospitals, private practice, and community mental health. I have expertise in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and have published a book on DBT for adolescents.

Counseling Philosophy:

I believe in working collaboratively to help clients to validate and accept themselves and to identify and change thoughts and behaviors that contribute to mental health concerns.
