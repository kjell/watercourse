## Careers at Watercourse

We views our employees as our strongest asset. We strive to provide compensation that will attract a diverse and talented team by staying competitive with our nonprofit peers.
 
When recruiting candidates for open positions, we will advertise on the [MN Council of Nonprofits job board](http://www.minnesotanonprofits.org/jobs){:target="_blank"}, on this website, and through our [email list](http://eepurl.com/bBBXSD){:target="_blank"} and social media.


#### Current openings:
- [Licensed Psychologist](http://www.minnesotanonprofits.org/job-details?id=130409) (part-time)
- [School-based Therapist](http://www.minnesotanonprofits.org/job-details?id=130404) (full-time)


## Internships & Practicum Opportunities

Each year, we accept 4-6 graduate students into our training program. Over the course of 9 months, we give students a solid foundation of practical experience needed to successfully work in the mental health field. Our student trainees tell us that our program is different from other programs – students aren’t stuck shadowing for months, nor are they thrown in without training or support.

#### Our training program offers:

* 16-20 hours a week of community-based mental health work in our clinics and schools
* 8 weeks of introductory training as you build a case load at our clinic and school sites
* Weekly student group, led by an experienced clinical supervisor
* Weekly all-staff meetings, trainings, and case consultations

Ideal participants can work autonomously and take on responsibility for a variety of tasks. We identify students who support our mission and have an interest in working with children, families, and adults from diverse communities. Familiarity with Spanish or Somali can be a strong asset in this placement, although it is not necessary.

#### To apply:

## Volunteer

Read on for opportunities to share your skills with the Watercourse community in a short- or long-term capacity.

#### Our biggest need: Spring 2016

Gardeners, landscapers, and permaculturists! Since 2008, Watercourse has partnered with the [VOA Southwest Center](http://www.voamnwi.org/southwest-center){:target="_blank"} to provide a community garden and fresh vegetables for local seniors. Our upcoming expansion will nearly double the size of our front yard, so a revamp of our community garden space is in the works. We need your help to maximize curb appeal and keep the garden accessible to the seniors who maintain it. Email [emilyi@watercoursecounseling.org]() to get involved in this project to transform our clinic and our neighborhood.
 
#### Other opportunities include but are not limited to:
* Greeting our clients and taking phone messages (2-4 hour shifts)
* Organizing a fundraiser or collection drive
* Helping us to plan and coordinate special events
* Photographing our staff and outreach work
* Supporting our administrative staff
* Providing childcare during our parenting groups
