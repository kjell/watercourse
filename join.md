# Careers at Watercourse

Watercourse Counseling Center views its employees as its strongest asset. We strive to provide compensation that will attract a diverse and competent employee base by staying competitive with the nonprofit market place with salary and benefit packages.
 
When recruiting candidates for open positions, we will advertise on the [MN Council of Nonprofits job board](http://www.minnesotanonprofits.org/jobs), on our website, and through our [email list](/contact.html).


# Internships & Practicum Opportunities

Each year, we accept 4-6 graduate students into our student training program. Over the course of nine months, we give students a solid foundation of practical experience and training needed to successfully work in the mental health field. Our student trainees tell us that our program is different from other programs – students aren’t stuck shadowing for months, nor are they thrown in without training or support.

The program starts with 8 weeks of training as the students build a case load at our clinic and school sites. Students support one another during their weekly student meetings and trainings, and can request help or guidance during case consultation at regular staff meetings and clinical consultations. As students gain experience with the clinical and administrative tasks that encompass mental health work, they take on more clients.

We seek students who can work autonomously and take on responsibility for a variety of tasks. We identify students who support our mission and have an interest in working with children, families, and adults from diverse communities. Familiarity with Spanish or Somali can be a strong asset in this placement, although it is not necessary.

To apply, send both resume and cover letter to jobs(at)watercoursecounseling.org
