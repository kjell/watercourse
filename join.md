# Careers at Watercourse

Watercourse Counseling Center views its employees as its strongest asset. We strive to provide compensation that will attract a diverse and competent employee base by staying competitive with the nonprofit market place with salary and benefit packages.
 
When recruiting candidates for open positions, we will advertise on the [MN Council of Nonprofits job board](http://www.minnesotanonprofits.org/jobs), on our website, and through our [email list](/contact.html).


# Internships & Practicum Opportunities

Each year, we accept 4-6 graduate students into our training program. Over the course of 9 months, we give students a solid foundation of practical experience needed to successfully work in the mental health field. Our student trainees tell us that our program is different from other programs – students aren’t stuck shadowing for months, nor are they thrown in without training or support.

Our training program offers:
* 8 weeks of introductory training as you build a case load at our clinic and school sites
* Weekly student group, led by an experienced clinical supervisor
* Weekly all-staff meetings, trainings, and case consultations

Ideal participants can work autonomously and take on responsibility for a variety of tasks. We identify students who support our mission and have an interest in working with children, families, and adults from diverse communities. Familiarity with Spanish or Somali can be a strong asset in this placement, although it is not necessary.

To apply:
* Complete a brief screening questionnaire [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yJkyiR5gRViSIFBrLAjQML7ZZbKNSy6FYUjlW1ktrlw/viewform?entry.702884059&entry.502240415=Please+check+that+this+is+accurate!&entry.845608170&entry.228968896&entry.1270550901&entry.1948455789&entry.2112202635&entry.220341584&entry.779605033&entry.1404859272)
