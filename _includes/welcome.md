"[Our school-based therapist] worked to get my son engaged and
comfortable, mixing work and play, getting him to open up. This has been
a positive experience from the very first session. Thanks for helping my
son 'turn it around' so beautifully. Having a genuine, warm therapist
with a sense of humor is a godsend!"</p>

We operate from a fundamental belief in the power of relationship in
life and in healing. Our approach relies on collaboration in which each
person matters and in which each peron's abilities, sense of self, and
life experiences are valued and utilized.

“My therapist offered support and asked the right questions.  The
treatment plan we wrote kept me in a progressive mindset and seeing and
feeling the changes was immeasurably motivating to continue.  I am
extremely grateful for having the opportunity to work with her.
Thanks!”</p>
